**A. Approach to Solving the Problem**
In solving this problem, I focused on building a simple, scalable solution with clear, understandable logic while adhering to the principles of clean code and maintainability. The key design decisions were based on the following considerations:

**Data Model Design:**

I chose to implement a self-referencing model for the Employee entity, leveraging TypeORM's @ManyToOne and @OneToMany decorators to define a parent-child relationship between employees (supervisor and subordinates). This allows for flexible, hierarchical data representation without the need for complex database structures.
The employee hierarchy is represented recursively, allowing employees to have children and for each child employee to potentially have their own children.

Simple Implementation:

The solution is kept simple by focusing on a single core functionality: creating employees and fetching their hierarchy.
I used the @Post endpoint to handle employee creation and a @Get endpoint to retrieve hierarchical employee data, making the API intuitive and easy to interact with.
Automated Tests:

To ensure the reliability of the solution, I implemented automated unit and integration tests using Jest. The tests cover the core functionality such as employee creation, hierarchy retrieval, and error handling.
Iâ€™ve focused on achieving high test coverage to ensure that edge cases (e.g., when no supervisor exists) are also covered.


**C.Logging:**

I implemented logging in a structured JSON format. This ensures that logs are standardized and easy to query when troubleshooting, especially in production environments.
Scalability Considerations:

The design supports easy scalability through horizontal scaling and database optimizations (e.g., indexed fields). Caching strategies (like Redis) can also be implemented for read-heavy endpoints.




**Deployment Instructions:**

To deploy the application:
Clone the repository.
Configure the .env file with appropriate environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys).
Build the Docker image using docker build -t employee-hierarchy.
Run the application with docker-compose up.
For production, use Kubernetes or a similar orchestration platform for better scalability and management.
